      <description>This week in Journal Club at the Mathieson Lab we discussed the recently published paper by Wang et. al (2020) on the theoretical aspects of the transferability of polygenic risk scores across ancestries.
This work provides three predictors for the relative accuracy of a polygenic risk scores (i.e., the accuracy in a test population with different ancestry than that from which the summary statistics came from,divided by the accuracy in an independent test sample of same ancestry as the original GWAS).</description>

      <description>Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarise the genetic information spread across several genetic variants into one single number. This number can be use to predict an individual&amp;rsquo;s phenotype or - more realistically - to place an individual in risk groups according to their PRS.
Many different steps are involved in calculating a PRS that is meaningful. For instance, the quality of the summary statistics is paramount. The choice of which variants to include in the PRS is also far from trivial and can involve simple ad hoc approaches (such as C+T) or model-based approaches such as LDpred and LDpred2.</description>

      <description>Today we discussed the new version of LDpred: LDpred2 (preprint here).
The preprint is short and technical and does not go through the trouble of explaining the models implemented in LDpred1 and LDpred2, since that has been described in great detail in the original publication. Rather, this seems to be a ‘Bioinformatics’ style preprint that goes straight to the novelties:
LDpred2 runs in R instead of in Python like its predecessor;</description>
