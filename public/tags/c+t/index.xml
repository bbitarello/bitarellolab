      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week in Journal Club at the Mathieson Lab we discussed the recently published paper by Wang et. al &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17719-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;(2020)&lt;/a&gt; on the theoretical aspects of the transferability of polygenic risk scores across ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This work provides three predictors for the relative accuracy of a polygenic risk scores (i.e., the accuracy in a test population with different ancestry than that from which the summary statistics came from,divided by the accuracy in an independent test sample of same ancestry as the original GWAS). The three different predictors differ in their assumptions. All of them assume that the causal variants are the same across populations and that their effect sizes are 100% correlated. Predictor 1 requires that one knows what the causal variants are, as well as their degree of linkage disequilibrium with the genome-wide significant SNPs. In practice that is rarelly if ever known. Predictor 2 approximates this by doing a heuristic approach to select candidate causal variants for each GWS SNP. Finally, Predictor 3 assumes (rather naively as the authors state) that the GWS SNPs are the causal SNPs. In summary, their three predictors capture the impact of LD and allelic frequencies on PRS performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Polygenic Risk Scores performance in diverse ancestry populations</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarise the genetic information spread across several genetic variants into one single number. This number can be use to predict an individual&amp;rsquo;s phenotype or - more realistically - to place an individual in risk groups according to their PRS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many different steps are involved in calculating a PRS that is meaningful. For instance, the quality of the summary statistics is paramount. The choice of which variants to include in the PRS is also far from trivial and can involve simple &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; approaches (such as C+T) or model-based approaches such as LDpred and LDpred2. Finally, there are the issues of validation and overfitting in the validation set, as well as the even more complicated issue of transferability of polygenic risk scores across ancestries. This project touches upon all of these issues, but particularly on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LDpred2: Better, Faster, Stronger</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we discussed the new version of LDpred: LDpred2 (preprint &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.066720v1.full.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The preprint is short and technical and does not go through the trouble of explaining the models implemented in LDpred1 and LDpred2, since that has been described in great detail in the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4596916/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;original publication&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, this seems to be a ‘Bioinformatics’ style preprint that goes straight to the novelties:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LDpred2 runs in R instead of in Python like its predecessor;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LDpred2 has four implementations (LDpred2-inf, LDpred2, LDpred2-sparse, LDpred2-auto), compared to two from its predecessor (LDpred-inf, LDpred);&lt;/p&gt;</description>
