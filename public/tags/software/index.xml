      <description>Tl; dr, I love to tell a good story. If you don&amp;rsquo;t wanna read that, no worries. Just skip ahead or get straight to business!
Now, to the story.
I have been working on a project where I was using population allelic frequencies for about 6,000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for CEU (North Americans from UTAH with European ancestry) individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. We have our own copy of this dataset in our computer, and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively straightforward to get those frequencies from vcf files.</description>

      <description>Today we discussed the new version of LDpred: LDpred2 (preprint here).
The preprint is short and technical and does not go through the trouble of explaining the models implemented in LDpred1 and LDpred2, since that has been described in great detail in the original publication. Rather, this seems to be a ‘Bioinformatics’ style preprint that goes straight to the novelties:
LDpred2 runs in R instead of in Python like its predecessor;</description>
