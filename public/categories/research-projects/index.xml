      <description>Balancing Selection is an umbrella term Balancing selection is an umbrella term for several selective mechanisms that result in the maintenance of adaptive genetic diversity in populations. Among these are heterozygote advantage, negative-frequency dependent selection, and selective pressures which vary in time and space, resulting in the maintenance of more than one allele segregating within a population for longer than expected under neutral evolution.</description>

      <description>Pronouns: she/her/hers
Fun Fact: I love to bake, listen to podcasts and feed stray cats.
In the Lab: Joined summer 2023 to work on an R package to calculate balancing selection. My interests are all things R! Also worked on developing an R package for the B215: Biostatistics with R course. Stayed until graduating (Spring 2024).

      <title>Polygenic Risk Scores performance in diverse ancestry populations</title>

      <description>Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarise the genetic information spread across several genetic variants into one single number. This number can be use to predict an individual&amp;rsquo;s phenotype or - more realistically - to place an individual in risk groups according to their PRS.
Many different steps are involved in calculating a PRS that is meaningful. For instance, the quality of the summary statistics is paramount. The choice of which variants to include in the PRS is also far from trivial and can involve simple ad hoc approaches (such as C+T) or model-based approaches such as LDpred and LDpred2.</description>
