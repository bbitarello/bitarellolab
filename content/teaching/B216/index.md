Genomics is a young and fast-evolving field of science that lies at the intersection of genetics, computer science, and biotechnology. We will examine the types of biological questions that can be answered using large biological data sets and complete genome sequences and the techniques and technologies that make such studies possible. Our primary focus will be on animal genomes and, in particular, human genomes, with special attention to evolutionary aspects of genomic data analysis.
